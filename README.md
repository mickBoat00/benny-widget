Embed into your external website like this

```<iframe 
    src="https://mickboat00.github.io/benny-widget/widget.html" 
    frameborder="0" 
    scrolling="no"
    style="position: fixed; 
    bottom: 0; right: 0; 
    width: 500px; height: 100vh;  
    border: none; 
    overflow: hidden; 
    z-index: 9999; background-color: t

For the width do not forget to make it responsive for small devices
